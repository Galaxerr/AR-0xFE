You find yourself a mail on your pc, with object "Save Me".
You soon realize, while reading it, that your friend FL4G (you only know him by his gamertag) was kidnapped, and he now needs your help.
The only clue to finding him is this distress call he sent you, saved in this url:

If you want to find him, you'll have to go through 4 obstacles, and navigate your way into the system until he is safe.
May luck be on your side.
